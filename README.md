# hello-world
my intro to git
Currently learning HTML/CSS/GIT/Client-Server architecture through tutorials and research. I started with Python tutorials and docs reading and am still going through those. I enjoy this very much and look forward to becoming skilled enough to be of service in whatever line of work I can.
